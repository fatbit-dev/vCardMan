# vCardMan

vCard Manager made in Python Qt5, with love &lt;3

## Installation

We have prepared a [devops](./devops/) directory with some handy scripts to install development enviroment.

Apart from these scripts, we may need to install QtDesigner. If that is the case, follow these instructions:

1. To use the visual Qt Designer tool, install pyqt5-tools:

```bash
pip install pyqt5-tools
```

After installation, launch Qt Designer by running (ensure your Python environment is active):

```bash
designer
```
